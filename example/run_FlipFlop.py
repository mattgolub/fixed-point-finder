    '''Initial states are sampled from states observed during realistic

    instantaneously from one stable state to another, observed networks states
    spend little if any time near the unstable fixed points. In order to
    identify ALL fixed points, noise must be added to the initial states
    before handing them to the fixed point finder. In this example, the noise
    needed is rather large, which can lead to identifying fixed points well
    outside of the domain of states observed in realistic behavior of the
